# BeamLoadCalculator
This is a project regarding simply supported beams with a rectangular cross section subjected 
to uniformly distributed load. The objective of this project is to create a program that can be 
used to calculate the uniformly distributed load that causes yield and plastic collapse at the 
critical section of the beam. The project is only applicable for beam materials where its 
normal strain distribution at the cross section varies linearly from zero at neutral axis and 
maximum at the furthest point from the neutral axis. The stress-strain diagram of the material 
should be the same for both tension and compression. It is assumed that the material of the 
beam exhibit elastic perfectly plastic behaviour when the stress in the material reaches yield 
stress. The program can be used to determine the maximum uniformly distributed load that 
can be applied on supporting beams or building frames where the material, cross section and 
length is specified. It can also be used to calculate the minimum requirements for different 
parameters to support a structure with a known load, which in turn saves costs and reduces 
wastage.
